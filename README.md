# Smart-Air-Condition-System
This project presents a simple and efficient temperature control system built using the ATmega328P microcontroller and the DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor. The system continuously monitors the surrounding environment and automatically responds when the measured temperature goes above or below a predefined threshold.
